;; Exercise 3.5 [h]
;;
;; (Exercise in alternating structure) Write a program that will play the role of the
;; guesser in the game Twenty Questions. The user of the program will have in mind
;; any type of thing. The program will ask questions of the user,
;; which must be answered yes or no, or "it" when the program has guessed it.
;; If the program runs out of guesses, it gives up and asks the user what "it" was.
;; At first the program will not play well, but each time it plays, it will remember
;; the user's replies and use them for subsequent guesses.
